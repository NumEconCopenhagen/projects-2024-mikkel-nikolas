# Model analysis project

Our project is titled ASAD model for a closed economy and is about how shocks affect the aggregate supply and aggregate demand in a closed economy. Furthermore, we investage and test what the optimal alpha might be, to avoid social losses.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
