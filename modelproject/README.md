# Model analysis project

Our project is titled Solow model for a closed economy with human capital. We investigate the solow model with human capital, and extend it, with tax, to see how this affect our model, estimations and transition diagrams. It is important when running the ipynb file to press Run All every time the file run. In order to display our interactive plot run the code in VSCode.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb]and[modelproject.py].

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
